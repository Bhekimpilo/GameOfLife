Here is a break down of the game logic

# There are six players at most and they take turns to spin a number wheel and move their characters.
# They have freedom to choose in some instances but in some tiles the commands are authoritative.
# The object of the game is to acquire as much wealth as possible and the money is added up at the end.
# Insurance, stock and houses are optional to buy. They are sold at a profit at the end.
# Wedding gifts are mandatory from every player if one lands on the marriage tile (Retired players don't pay).
# That said, the board is colour coded as a way of giving instructions to the character as it moves by or lands.


Here are the colour code meanings

# RED - Stop and spin again but DO NOT continue moving even with moves left. In the case of a marriage you can spin either red or black to determine the gift amount each player gives you. In the Day of reckoning tile (last tile), you are to choose a number and spin, if that number turns up you move to millionnaire acres and you liquidate your assets and continue to collect rents and bridge tolls

# AMBER - You pause to pick an option but you continue until all your moves are exhausted.

# GREEN - don't stop but do collect the money in case of a Pay day tile or pay the money for the purpose stated (e.g speding tickt or toll bridge). If you land on pay day as opposed to passing you get a landing bonus of $10,000.

# ORANGE - this assigns you a salary rate in case you did not land on a salary tile earlier

# BLACK - these have instructions you follow only when you land on them.

There are different actin codes to help you know what to modify, cash, bank loan, insurance amount, stock, house value etc.

The bank will give you a loan as per need but you will have to pay interest as you pass the green "Interest Due tiles". 

At the end you pay all loans and sell all your stuff to IF you retire to Millionnare acres otherwise you lose everything once you lose the final spin to win at the day of reckoning. You get bonuses for kids you have and if you are married.
